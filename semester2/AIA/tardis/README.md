cleaned_dataset.csv - the dataset cleaned

station.csv - list of correct station

tardis_dashboard.py - the analytic website code

tardis_eda.ipynb - dataset cleaner

tardis_model.ipnb - dataset prevision creator

# Dataset Cleaner
Clean every wrong data like wrong station name, date, service, and incoherent values

It also create new column like percentage of delay train over normal train

and it create some graphic so you can see data in real time to check if the process realy works

# Website
You can select a departure station and after that it give you a list of possible arrival station

When you have selected both it show you an estimated travel time in XXhXXm
